🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This is a simple Machine Learning project that classifies Iris flowers into three species using the classic Iris dataset. The dataset includes measurements of sepal and petal sizes, and the goal is to build a model that can predict the species based on these measurements.

📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains three species of Iris flowers — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — with 150 samples total. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

In this project you will:

Load and explore the Iris dataset

Preprocess the data

Train and evaluate a classification model

Understand how well the model predicts flower species

📊 How It Works

Data Loading & Visualization – Load IRIS.csv and visualize feature distributions.

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values (if any), split into features and labels.

Model Training – Train a classifier (e.g., Decision Tree, KNN, SVM).

Evaluation – Compute accuracy to check how well the model predicts species.

🚀 Expand the Project
